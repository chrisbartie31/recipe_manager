# *The Recipe Storage*
### 💻 How to compile and run the Recipe Storage
---
This is a C# WPF program, which is a recipe storage system that will store the recipe name, amount of ingredients, ingredient name and quantitiy, calories for each ingredient, total calories for the recipe, unit of measurement and the number of steps in the recipe with a description of each step, entered by you (the user). 
The Recipe Storage user will be greeted with a menu on the home screen, containing 5 buttons, being:
- 1: Enter a Recipe
- 2: View a Recipe
- 3: Scale a Recipe
- 4: Reset Quantities
- 5: Clear Storage

### 📚 How to Add and View a Recipe
---
- Click the 'Enter a Recipe' button and follow the prompts in the form of labelled textboxes
- Click the buttons to take you to the next phase of entering a recipe
- Once you enter the final step, you will be taken back to the home screen
- Click the 'View a Recipe' button and you can either search for a recipe by name or display all recipes and you will be greeted with a message box displaying all of the recipes details
- There is also a button called 'Clear Storage' that will clear all recipes in the storage

If you press the Display Recipes to display the recipe's and there has not been a recipe stored, you will be shown an error message saying  **"Please enter a recipe, none were found"**

### ⚖️Recipe Scaling 
---
You have the ability to scale your recipe in 3 different ways, once you have successfully entered a recipe:

- Press 'Scale a Recipe' on the menu
- Choose either 0,5 or 2 or 3 depending on the scale amount you would like
- Re-do the viewing recipe process as stated earlier
- You will be able to reset the quantities for an individual recipe or all recipes

### 🍔Filter Recipe
---
You have the ability to add filters when searching for recipes, in 3 different ways:

- Ingredient Name (which recipes include an ingredient)
- Food Group (which recipes include a set food group)
- Maximum Calories (which recipes are less than or equalled to a set maximum calorie value)

### Changes Made
  ---
- I have made sure that the GUI is capable of displaying multiple recipes, through the use of a rich text box.
- I have added the filtering option for the users to filter their recipes by ingredient name, food group, or maximum calories.
